## About Me

I've been working in the software industry for over two years, with a primary focus on .NET development. During this time, I've had the opportunity to work on some exciting projects that include:

- **Creating CRM System**: As a key member of the development team, I contributed to the creation of a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. This mission-critical project aimed to consolidate and manage extensive data sources, ensuring that authorized users could access specific taxpayer information efficiently. This system played a pivotal role, providing accurate insights and improving decision-making processes.

- **Internal Project Management Application**: I also worked on an internal application that facilitated project management within our company. This application allowed employees to create and manage projects, assign tasks to team members, and track project progress. It was built using ASP.NET with React and played a crucial role in improving our project workflow.
